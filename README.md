Welcome to the YITH WooCommerce Wishlist repository on GitHub. Here you can browse the source, look at open issues and keep track of development.

## About plugin

What can really make the difference in conversions and amount of sales is without a doubt the freedom to share your own wishlist, even on social networks, increasing indirect sales: can you imagine the sales volume you can generate during holidays or birthdays, when relatives and friends will be looking for the wishlist of your clients to buy a gift?

Offer to your visitors a chance to add the products of your woocommerce store to a wishlist page. With YITH WooCommerce Wishlist you can add a link in each product detail page,
in order to add the products to the wishlist page. The plugin will create you the specific page and the products will be added in this page and
afterwards add them to the cart or remove them.
